Tasks to complete:

- Complete the circuit design with the output and battery management system for power delivery
- Collect all components needed for the project
- Finish schematic of the project
- Write the firmware for the microcontroller to communicate and/or control the LCD screen, battery management system/battery gauge (I2C), two Buck-Boost convertors (EN pin), motor rotation and power generation readings through internal comparator and external op amps.
- Decide whether to be USB 1.1 compliant (5V, 500mA) or USB-C compliant (5-20V, 500-5KmA) with power transfer.
- Create a filter to limit noise generated from the dirty, uneven DC power of the motor as well as for the output for charging.
- Design the soft-latch circuit to turn on or off the device
- Test the circuit once it is complete. Any issues? Put them in Log book and remedy the issue
